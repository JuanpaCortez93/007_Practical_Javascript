# 007_Practical_Javascript
This repository contains a guide how I use Javascript to resolve a professional problem provided by Platzi. The design team give me all the views separated in different pages and I need to layout all components in just one page. 
My objectives/acceptance criteria is the following:

1. Order the index.html file with the navbar menu, shopping card, shopping products items and products list in just one file. 
2. Follow good practices in HTML5, CSS3 and JS (if is possible).
3. Do the desing completely responsive.
4. Give interactivity to the page using JS (main objective of this project).
5. Follow a professional workflow.
6. Aditionally, as an extra step, I decided to set-up the shopping cart, their prices and products. 

Finally I complete the acceptance criteria in 8 hours and you can check the result in the following URL: https://juanpacortez93.github.io/007_Practical_Javascript/.
